Tests: Captures information about medical tests conducted, results, and associated illnesses.

Additionally, the database includes tables for billing, cafeteria services, and staff roles, ensuring a holistic representation of hospital operations.


üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
Data Management: Efficient storage and retrieval of comprehensive hospital data.

Relational Integrity: Use of foreign keys and constraints to maintain data consistency across tables.

Sample Data: Pre-populated tables with sample entries to facilitate testing and demonstration.

Complex Queries: Supports intricate SQL queries to extract meaningful insights, such as staff assignments, patient treatments, and departmental statistics.

This project serves as an educational tool for understanding hospital data workflows and SQL database management. It's suitable for students, educators, and professionals interested in healthcare data systems.
